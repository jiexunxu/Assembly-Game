# Introduction
This game is written in Assembly Code as a tribute to the very early days of computer games. It can be run under MS-DOS.

# Instructions
The game has four paddles on the borders of the screen. 

When you move your mouse, the bottom and the right paddle will move along the direction of the mouse, but the top and left paddle will move against the direction of the mouse.

Use the mouse to control the paddles and catch all purple, white and light green balls, avoid all black, blue and red balls!

If you CATCH a bad ball, you lose a life. Additionally, 
- If you catch a blue ball, the paddle that catches it freezes
- If you catch a red ball, the paddle that catches it will lose control

If you MISS a white ball, the screen will flash. You lose a life by missing a purple, white or light green ball.

If your score exceeds an integer multiple of 200, you earn 1 extra life. 

You can press Alt+Enter to switch to full screen to have a better gameplay. Press any key to exit during the game.
